Build a professional and modern developer portfolio using **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion** with the following specifications:

✅ Tech Stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router with `app/` directory)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Use **JavaScript** (not TypeScript)

✅ Theme:
- Dark futuristic design with glassmorphism style.
- Neon gradient accents (violet → cyan).
- Font: "Inter" or "Poppins" from Google Fonts.
- Fullscreen animated background:
  - Gradient waves shifting slowly.
  - Floating neon particles/orbs that connect with glowing lines when near (network effect).
  - Particles slightly repel from cursor.
  - Optimized for performance using Canvas or lightweight Three.js.

✅ Pages:
1. `/` → Home
   - Fullscreen hero section (disable scroll with `overflow-hidden`).
   - Centered content:
     - Name: "Yash Gautam"
     - Subtitle: "Full-Stack & DevOps Engineer"
     - Social buttons: GitHub, LinkedIn, Email
       - Buttons: glassmorphism pill style
         - Default: transparent glass with neon border
         - Hover: smooth center-out fill animation (violet → cyan), text turns white
     - CTA button: "View Projects" → navigates to `/projects`.
   - Animations:
     - Hero text: fade-in + slide-up on load
     - Buttons: staggered fade + scale-in
     - Background: fade/blur in on load

2. `/projects` → Projects Showcase
   - Enable scroll
   - Sticky navbar at top with:
     - Left: "← Home" link
     - Right: site title
   - Grid of project cards:
     - Each card: glassmorphism with title, description, tech badges, and buttons (Visit, Code)
     - Buttons: same hover animation as hero buttons
     - Hover effect: card background softly fills with neon glow
   - Animations:
     - Cards animate in with staggered fade + slide-up using Framer Motion

✅ Animations:
- Framer Motion for:
  - Page transitions (fade + slight scale)
  - Staggered animations for text/buttons/cards
- Background particles animate smoothly using Canvas

✅ Deliverables:
- Full Next.js 14 project structure:
  - `app/` folder for pages
  - `components/` folder for Navbar, Hero, Button, ProjectCard, Background
- TailwindCSS properly configured
- Framer Motion integrated
- Example projects added in `/projects` page

⚡ Goal:
A fully responsive, dark-themed, futuristic portfolio site with smooth animations and a unique interactive background.
